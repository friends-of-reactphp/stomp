# React/STOMP

STOMP bindings for React.

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/reactphp/stomp.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/reactphp/stomp)

## Install

The recommended way to install react/stomp is [through composer](http://getcomposer.org).

```JSON
{
    "require": {
        "react/stomp": "0.1.*"
    }
}
```

## Example

You can interact with a STOMP server by using the `React\Stomp\Client`.

```php
<?php

$loop = React\EventLoop\Factory::create();
$factory = new React\Stomp\Factory($loop);
$client = $factory->createClient(array('vhost' => '/', 'login' => 'guest', 'passcode' => 'guest'));

$client
    ->connect()
    ->then(function ($client) use ($loop) {
        $client->subscribe('/topic/foo', function ($frame) {
            echo "Message received: {$frame->body}\n";
        });

        $loop->addPeriodicTimer(1, function () use ($client) {
            $client->send('/topic/foo', 'le message');
        });
    });

$loop->run();
```

## Acknowledgement

When subscribing with the `subscribe` method, messages are considered
acknowledged as soon as they are sent by the server (ack header is set to 'auto').

You can subscribe with a manual acknowledgement by using `subscribeWithAck`
(see http://stomp.github.com//stomp-specification-1.1.html#SUBSCRIBE for
available ack values).

You will get a `React\Stomp\AckResolver` as second argument of the callback to
acknowledge or not the message :

```php
$client->subscribeWithAck('/topic/foo', 'client', function ($frame, $ackResolver) {
    if ($problem) {
        $ackResolver->nack();
    } else {
        $ackResolver->ack();
    }
});
```

## Todo

* Support nul bytes in frame body
* Heart-beating
* Consuming ACKs
* Transactions
* Streaming frame bodies (using stream API)

## Tests

To run the test suite, you need PHPUnit.

    $ phpunit
